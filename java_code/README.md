# Rabies simulator in Java

The code in this folder is that used to simulate rabies dynamics in the context of the manuscript.

The code is provided for replication purposes only. It was written to establish the most important 
processes of rabies transmission and dynamics, and thus explicitly simulates processes that have
been found to be unnecessary.

Individuals wishing to simulate rabies dynamics should contact the corresponding author for more 
efficient code that has been developed on the basis of the findings from this work.
